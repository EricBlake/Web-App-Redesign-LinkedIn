Strengths- LinkIn has a great deal of name recognition. In business terms in it is on the same lines facebooking someone. If your interested of looking as someone's perfessional history, your go to LinkedIn and connect. It is easy to sign up for the site. It lonly takes about a minute to sign in for the first time and then you can begin editing your page or looking for contacts. Linked in is good about suggesting connections for you on the People You May Know page.



Weaknesses- It is very difficult to locate another person during a search. Once located it is difficult to find where to add them to your connections. There are too many paths on the profile page. There are dozens of options for you to proceed once you arrive. your profile page is the exact same page as you editing page for your profile. The profile page needs to me more simplified with tabs and categories instead of everything being listed in one long page.



Opportunity-If LinkedIn can simplify its site it would result in a much better user experience. If search results could be narrowed down with a side nav it would make it easier to find the person you are looking for.



Threats-New web apps are showing up every day trying to become the next big thing. If LinkedIn continues to provide sub-par user experience it could result in getting knocked off its top ranking and being replaced with another app that offers better features. LinkedIn could be the proffesional MySpace of the future.
