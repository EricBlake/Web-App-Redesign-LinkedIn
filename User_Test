User was asked to create a Linked In Profile. This was very simple. All that was needed along with him filling out basic information (e.g. Name & Email Address) was following a link on a confirmation email. This is standard on alot of Web App sites.

2.
User was asked to locate and add me as a linked in connection. When searching just my name Eric Blake, he was unable to locate me as a user. I did advise the user that I am from Houston (I didn't feel this made the test results invalid as he would have probably known this information if he were adding me for business purposes.)

Again with the knowledge of my Full Name: Eric Blake & city of origin: Houston, the user was unable to locate my profile. 

I did advise the user that my previous employer was Stewart Title (Again, I don't think this made the results invalid because in a business situation the user would have probably know this.) After quite abit more searching the user was able to locate my profile. The search process took around 3-4 minutes, which is fairly lengthy compared to the search options on other social media sites.


The user was asked to request to connect with me. The user scrolled the page 4 times before he had a general direction of where to go to add me as a connection. He finally located the drop down menu and after some questions about how he knew me was able to send a connection request.

The biggest issue with the site apart from the poor search tools is there is not a quick button on the profile page to connect with another user. It requires a drop down menu with the word connect in small font. For a website that was built on building business connections, that is precisely the most difficult task to accomplish. A button to connect with users on their profile page is necessary.
